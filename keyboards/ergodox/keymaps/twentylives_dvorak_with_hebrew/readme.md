#Dvorak-Hebrew

* This layout solves the problem of Dvorak Keyboard with OS QWERTY, which when you change to hebrew all the letters scrumble, the second layer is the Hebrew (top left button), which you can use on any computer, Plug and play.

* The Hebrew layout itself solve another problem with the different locations of punctuation on Dvorak/Hebrew with few minor changes, it's based on Yuval Rabinovich's layout which you can find here : http://heboard.wordpress.com for regular QWERTY keyboards and for other operation systems.

* these are only good when using a public computer or one you can't change settings on, because you need to change both keyboard layout and os layout each time you change language. A better solution is to use [hebrew-hw-dvorak](https://github.com/20lives/hebrew-hw-dvorak) as os layout.
